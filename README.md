# A wrapper of COCO for fmincon in MATLAB

## COCO
Continuation Core (COCO) is a MATLAB-based open-source package for computational nonlinear analysis of dynamical systems. It uses atlas algorithms to cover the solution manifolds to nonlinear systems. A unique feature of COCO is the embedded construction philosphy of nonlinear systems, where a large problem is assembed by some small subproblems with weak couplings. This object-oriented construction paradigm enables us to build a
